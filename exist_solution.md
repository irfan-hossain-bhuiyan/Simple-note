$$f(\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix})=\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}$$

### So the question is:
is there a solution for every real x,y,z (It doesn't have to be for every a,b) . It shouldn't because you can't make two variable to three variable.I am ignoring **Hilbert curve** from this topic.

Even if the $f_D=R^3$ and $f_R=R^3$ . It doesn't still confirm that the **corange** of this function will be R^3 for every function.My question is if there is an algorithm that can verify if the function has those properties or not.

### From where I got this idea.
There are three object in 3d dimension in different position. They don't have to be same density eveverywhere.Proof that there is a plane intersect the three of the object and split them in equal mass.



## My Thought:
I can turn this into function f(a,b)
