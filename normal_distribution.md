## This note is to understand normal_distribution

I have trouble understanding normal_distribution for some time.
Suppose you have an unbaised coin.You are flipping it **N** times. So in the proof it says 
$\sigma \propto \sqrt{N}$ which means deviation increase with **N** . Now as I know,the more **N** increase the more
it should get close to 0.

Where as the deviation is increasing.What I was thinking about is the percentage of diaviation which is with increasing with **N** getting smaller. As $\frac{\sqrt{N}}{N}$ is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ which is less.
