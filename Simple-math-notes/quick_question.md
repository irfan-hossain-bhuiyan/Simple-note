## Here are some basic question came to my mind when thinking->
### Understanding entropy: 
According to 2nd law of thermodynamics **You can't transfer heat from a colder environment to a hotter environment in spontaneous proces
s.** 

Now what would be considered spontaneous process.If I create solar panel to store energy and than create heat with it will it be considered spontaneous process.

#### Thought about this probem:
1. First I need to think about the entropy law with the equation.
2. Maybe said things about spontaneous process is not the think it should be.
#### Solution:
Here,As I thought,The word spontaneous is a confusing term.The main thing is entropy should be increased in respect to time.
So,you can transfer heat from source **A** to source **B** even though T(B)>T(A)*[Here T(x) is temprature of that source.]*.All you need is heat source C where T(C)<T(A) to increase the entropy in there.
