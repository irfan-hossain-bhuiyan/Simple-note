Distribution of primes:
   1. The probibility of choosing a number at random being prime in range (1,x) is $1/ln(x)$.
    The ratio of  p_1=(the number of prime number not excedding primes) and x/ln(x) approach 1 as x goes to infinite.
2. Prove that there are infinitely many prime of ak+b,where a,k are coprime and $k \in N$ .2
3. Prove that $\forall k \in N \exists a,b \in N \forall(1<i<k) ai+b \in P$
