There are different number of infinite,
It's considered n(R) is bigger infinite than n(N),But the proof has some problem for me,
like it uses some contriversial axiom in set theory,
    A set can be created from other sets taking some elements from them.
It might be true,or not,
    but let's say two function $f(n)=n$ and
    $g(n)=2^n$,both of those function range grows as n goes to infinity in natual steps,
    In one frame,$n(R)=g(n)$ and $n(N)=f(n)$ for n goes to infinity.
