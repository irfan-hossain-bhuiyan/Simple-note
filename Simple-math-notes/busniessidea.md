While eating KFC chicken fry,I thought to myself,why aer this so popular.This are the thing that came to mind:

1. This are dry,You don't have to worry about spilling it.
2. It has a corn cotting,Which is great resource for fibre.
With enough cotting it could replace rice and meat,
3. You don't have to prepare anything,It's readymate.It means You don't need to bring out dishes.
Just like potato chips,grab and eat.
4. Unlike potato chips,It has great amount of protien,fibre,
5. That's why this thing sell like chips.
6. If you don't have to do anything,It makes you eat more.
My busniess idea is to make 
1.every necesasry food(also fast food like pizza,burger) packet based,
readymate,dry(don't worry about spilling it.Also keep it fresh for a long time.)
