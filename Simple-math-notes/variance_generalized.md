In variance $V[x]=E[(x-E[x])^2]$
Even though amazing in look you can $V[x]=E[x^2]-E[x]^2$ so you can split the power to separate it,
Here is the relation,$I=I_G+Mh^2$ can be mapped to $E[x^2]=V[x]+E[x]^2$
There are some amazing features,like $E[(x+h)^2]=V[x]+E[x+h]^2$
,Is there a way for it to work in high dimension,So the $\sum{(x+h)^2} can also be split into summation?$
