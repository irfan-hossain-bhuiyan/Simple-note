# Trying to answer the question what exactly true and false means.

>true and false are two sets of statement that are **cosets**.
>So  one statement can't be in both true and false at the same time.One of the main principle of math.

But what it means not to be true and false at the same time.Does all statement fall to T(true set) or F(False set).
Isn't there any middle ground.

I can relate True and False statement set with set of numbers.
like negative number set are false and positive number set are true
>I can turn any positive to neagtive with adding minus to it.

>I can turn any true statement to false by adding "not" to it.

So shouldn't there be something like 0 for statement set.The value doesn't change if I add not to it.

Like -0  is still 0.There are 2 things we could do for 0
1.We could add 0 to both negative and positive number set.
2.Make a new set with 0

There are some statement they are like 0 for numbers.They are true and false at the same time.
Ex:
1.This statement is not true.
2.This statement is true.

"This statement is true" can be both true and false.If I add not to it then "This statement is false" is also both true and false.Unlike the statement 1 where just true or false satisfy the statement hte second one have to be both true and false at the same time.

### Now is there any way to connect it with halting problem:

## Thinking:
How can we separaret things in a set into two sets.We can split more from there.
1. is we can separate it if the element has certian prpreties na dother set if it doesn't has those properties.
So if S is a set of all statement,than We could split the set into two sets (true) and (not true).
But is (not true) is the same things as false.I don't think so.
2. Can I explain functionaly what true and false acctually means??
3. 

### Different prespective about true and false

True and false represent two state of an object,things is an objetc
can't have two state at once.Like health of a player.
Now why is true and false are popular to represent state of a proposition,Why not 3 or 4 state to analyze a problem,Like we do,modulo is an example of finite state,but why true,false is more useful,What's it even mean to be true or falae in mathematic frame of view.

1. My first opinion about true and false is that they define 2 state of a property,Now combining them into a struct I can have state of 4,8,16 and so on,You can have them with just one state,2 is the minimum state that needed to be defined. 

> Is there a way to set state equivalent to $\sqrt{2}$ like having a tuple of 2 $\sqrt{2}$ state having 2 state,how can I model such a thing.

2. This is not a wise way to explain true and false,like true and false implies a proposition,That is not discussed in point **1**.
