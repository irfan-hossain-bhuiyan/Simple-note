How do you define a object?
It is of what relation it has with other object.
So what is the standard object from where we can verify every other object.

There isn't any,you have to first define one object to be this like 1,then deduce what other object could be from that prespective. The list of object and the relation between can be considered a world.

Now let's say you have defined a object,you are defining other object with relation to this object. You have found several object that obeys the same relation,Now what do you do?Function is the best way to have relation between two objects.If multiple object obeys the relation you can't map that with function,as function can't output multiple object,

One solution is to define all the object that have the same property to be equivalent.On that world they are equivalent.Like 1,4,7 are not equal in natural number but they are in modulo 3 world.
