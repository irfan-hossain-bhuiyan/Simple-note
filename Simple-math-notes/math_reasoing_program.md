# A program that can do mathematical reasoning.

## TODO:
1.A standard mathematical language that has no edge cases.If possible.[More description here](#standard-mathematical-language)

2.What are the things computer need to learn to understand induction.Why induction work?What are the simple reasoning skill you need to know that it does work.[More description here](#how-generic-or-induction-actually-work)

3.prove of pegion hole principle.This should come at last.[More description here](#A-prove-for-pigeon-hole-principle)

4.How prove by assuming wrong works(Prove by contradiction).[description](#prove-by-contradiction)

5.A prove for pigeon hole principle.[description](#a-prove-for-pigeon-hole-principle)

6.Prove of a\*(b+c)=a\*b+a\*c.[description](#prove-of-distribution-of-multiplication)

7.Prove of a\*b=b\*a.[description](#prove-of-subtitution)

Current ideas that I have in my minds are [here](#recent-ideas)


## Standard mathematical language

## How generic or induction actually work
### Example:
I need some induction example to go forward and come some ideas.
1. 

## Make computer understand continuity of a system

## What true and false means

## Prove by contradiction

## A prove for pigeon hole principle

## Prove of distribution of multiplication

## Prove of subtitution


## Recent ideas
1.Think about global set G. A set that contains every possible things abstract or not in the universe. A feature F is a subset of G for G that obeys F.Like R(real number set) is the subset of G that implements all the features a real number should have.
2.
