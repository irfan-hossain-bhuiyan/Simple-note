function are viewed as relation between two sets.
But is that a good way.A set only contains what it has or doesn't has.Mapping it with other can be confusing.
For me viewing function as relation between two vector makes much more sense.

But it will than be harder to explain one_to_one function actually means.

There is a feature called size in set.What extactly is this?
If set only has idea of only it's components than what is size.

For me size is a test to see if any set can have one-to-one connection with other.
if n(A)=n(B) than A and B can have one_to_one connection.

let's U be the universal set,Than I can split the set with different cosets but they are connected to each other.
Like I can split them with the size of the set and define a function n(S) to define they are seperated.
Kinda like vector represented with function
