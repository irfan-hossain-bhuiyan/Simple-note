The relation between circuits in linear in most part.That why there is electronic,which makes a non linear relation in the system.
Now basic circuit has nonlinear relationship when it comes to frequency.

Like,
1.A transformer don't carry voltage to the output when the frequncy of the input comes to 0,
2.The reactance of a capacitor behave like non-linear when comes to frequency,Can I make computer only depends on that?
Like all logic gates,but it depends on frequency rather voltage.
