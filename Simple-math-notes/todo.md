#Here are all the todo I want to do

1.Go to RApl group,and check the all previos competition,try to solve thrm.



1. Understand fourier transform in depth.
2. 3b1b understand fast fourier transfrom,convoultion,normal distrubition
3. Solve the problem of coin problem in efficient method(shortest possible way to give money)
4. ball bouncing problem(when it will go to the point.)
5. get a better function approximation than newton method.
6. Study neural network and transformer in depth.
7. Prove that $H_{2n}>1+\frac{n}{2}$ where $H_n$ is the sum of harmonic series to 1/n.
