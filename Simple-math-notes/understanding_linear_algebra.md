# This article is to understanding linear algebra.

The rules vector need to follow are
1. u+(v+w)=(u+v)+w 
2. v+w=w+v
3. There is vector 0 such that 0+v=v
4. For every v there is -v
5. a(bv)=(ab)v
6. 1.v=v
7. a(v+w)=av+aw
8. (a+b)v=av+bv
9. u+v is in V,(closure under addition.)
10.a.u is in V,(closure under multiplication)
Here,$a$ is considered a scalar,and $v,w,u$ is considered vector.Now an scalar is also a vector.Because it obeys all the property of a vector.
So I can thing linear algebra as relation and opearation between vectors.

### Now what is vector?
Vector is a adding of objects.
Now what is addtion,
Some example of addtion is,addition of number,addition of different molecule, it means combining new things to get a new thing,the output only depends on the input,it doesn't care about the permutation or order of the way the things are added.


### ToDO:
Understand how derivative and summation work with linear operation,
like (d/dx)(d/dy)f(x)g(y)=(d/dx)f(x)(d/dy)g(y),
so the linear algebra d/dx is a linear transformation,
Why I am passing f(x) as constant in (d/dy) and in case of summation 
Also 
$\sum_{i}^n \sum_{j}^m i.j = $

What is similarity and dissimilarity between multiply,
dot product and linear function (aka matrix multiplication)

Like all of them are linear functions(dot product,multiply.matrix multiplication)
### TODO:
If multiplication is a linear operation,it can be treated as a matrix,
1. Then how multiplication of polynomial can be written as a matrix.
2. How a polynomial of multiple order of variable like x,y,z can be represented as a vector,
Is that a higher dimensional vector.
2. How one linear operation works with other linear operation.Like dot product.
    Like if $L(R)->R$ is alinear function,Than $L(\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \end{pmatrix} .\begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix} )$=$\begin{pmatrix} L(a) \\ L(b) \end{pmatrix} . \begin{pmatrix} c \\ d \end{pmatrix}$ .That is sometihng showed in equivalance relation.

    If I try to use this example in 

    $Differentiation( \begin{pmatrix} x^2 \\x^3 \end{pmatrix} . \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix})$

.It works on left side like $\begin{pmatrix} 2x \\ 3x^2 \end{pmatrix} . \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$ but not other way around $\begin{pmatrix} x^2 \\x^3 \end{pmatrix} . \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$

4. Is matrix is just a vector of vectors?If that is why is square matrix valuable than other,It has a operation to take inverse.
4. How transpose actually make sense in a vector?
5. $F:R^n->R$,where there is a one to one mapping to all function of of that type
    with a vector,which we call dot product.
    How every linear function can be treated as a matrix,which is also a combination of dot product.
