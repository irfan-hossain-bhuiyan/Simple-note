There are some things I regret about:
1. Didn't talk to barber when I know he is giving me a horrible cutting.I was one to give money.
2. Didn't bargain because someone says he knew me well.Did actually take extra charge.

Exam Problem:

1. In physics 1203 lab final,I was exjausted doing all the lab reprt,I didn't bind my lab report and 
    miss one lab report,Didn't punch it.
2. In cse 1204 OOp lab final,I didn't cheat.
3. In cse 2104 lab quiz,I got there working up,Forgot how Lab final quiz have 20 marks in it.
    Witout practicing it,I did mistake a lot in modular arithemetic.
4. In lab final,I have 2 bit difference,I know 2 bit difference means,positive if two bits are 
difference.Still I feel like who does 2 bit difference,I made 2 bit match.
5. I had to practice all the counter for at leasst 5 minute,I got a bad mark.
