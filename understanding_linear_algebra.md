# This article is to understanding linear algebra.

The rules vector need to follow are
1. u+(v+w)=(u+v)+w 
2. v+w=w+v
3. There is vector 0 such that 0+v=v
4. For every v there is -v
5. a(bv)=(ab)v
6. 1.v=v
7. a(v+w)=av+aw
8. (a+b)v=av+bv
9. u+v is in V,(closure under addition.)
10.a.u is in V,(closure under multiplication)
Here,$a$ is considered a scalar,and $v,w,u$ is considered vector.Now an scalar is also a vector.Because it obeys all the property of a vector.
So I can thing linear algebra as relation and opearation between vectors.

### Now what is vector?
Vector is a adding of objects.
Now what is addtion,
Some example of addtion is,addition of number,addition of different molecule, it means combining new things to get a new thing,the output only depends on the input,it doesn't care about the permutation or order of the way the things are added.


### ToDO:
Understand how derivative and summation work with linear operation,
like (d/dx)(d/dy)f(x)g(y)=(d/dx)f(x)(d/dy)g(y),
so the linear algebra d/dx is a linear transformation,
Why I am passing f(x) as constant in (d/dy) and in case of summation 
Also 
$\sum_{i}^n \sum_{j}^m i.j = $
