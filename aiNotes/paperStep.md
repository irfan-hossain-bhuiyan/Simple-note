1. Visualize the training data,
    Like the see the data as doctor sees it and color the data for infected
    and normal different to get a better understanding of it.
2. Understand the report they have done here [](https://www.kaggle.com/code/twtylerwilson/starter-ecg-heartbeat-categorization-8431d523-6)
3. Next this one ![](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zeinnugroho/kelompok-3)
4. Give the data to llm(chatgpt),and 
    1. try to make two neural network with naive bayes,SVM,and see the error it returns,(this approach d    epends on the data,Like if the data we are working is more like 1d image like data SVM+Knn will work ok,)
5. Can I generate more data?Like in image dataset,we can make dataset 100 times larger,just by shifting the image,rotate it sightly and scale it slightly,Can I do it in ecg dataset too?

Later decision will come after this
